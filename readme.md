# demo
<subtitle>a [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/) clone.</subtitle><br>
the name *demo* was chosen by intellij.

## choices
* i chose java, because it started as a java 'school project'
* i chose javafx, because it was more modern than swing/awt
* first commits are german, because it started as a school project

## setup
i recommend intellij, although maven and javafx plugin should be enough.
1. clone with git
   * windows: (https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   * linux (you should know it)
   * `git clone https://github.com/luk51/demo`

2. open project in intellij
    * to run click View>Tool Windows>Maven
    * in the Maven window click: Plugins>javafx:run
    * you can also try in the terminal `./mvnw javafx:run` but you need to set *JAVA_HOME* correctly
